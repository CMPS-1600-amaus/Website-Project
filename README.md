# Website-Project
Welcome to Project 2 1600 students. Now this project will be nothing like you have seen before. We will be working with a few important technologies today, that are seen in most corporate tech stacks:
- Typescript
- Firebase Authentication
- Next.js Dev environment
- Tailwind CSS
- Node Package Manager

# Pre Requisites

You will need to set up a few things before we can start messing around in our development environment. First thing we will need to do is install node package manager. 
- https://nodejs.org/en/download

Please use the link above to download node package manager onto your computers. This is how we will be able to download our packages on start up for your development environment. Once this is donwloaded you will need to navigate into the directory of where you cloned this github repository, you can do this either with your terminal instance or from within VS Code's terminal. The once you navigate into your Website-Project, please run the following command

``` bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the neccessary packages from your package.json file. This file is where all the neccessary packages for your project will live. if you would like to install outside packages for your 3rd milestone, the install command is as follows:

```bash
npm install name-of-package@version-of-package
```

Normally the default for version is the newest long term support version of the packages. In most cases that is perfectly fine. Once you have installed your packages you can proceed to milestone 1. 

# Milestone 1: Reading Documentation
This milestone primarily focuses on 3 major technologies that will be important to understand for this project. The following documentation links will be neccessary for milestone 1. 
- https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started
- https://react.dev/learn
- https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/firebaseui

Now a lot of this will seem very new to you guys, and it is supposed to be. We are not looking for an in depth understanding of every concept within these links. The goal of this milestone is to start to experience what it is like to navigate documentation. This is a very important skill within professional working environments, and will help you in the future when you need to pick up languages or technologies on the fly. 

**Your Tasks**: For this milestone you should read the documentation from above and be able to answer the questions below, as well as document all the files within the src/app folder. My only word of advice is to not skip reading this documentation, yes you can find these answers relatively quick. The issue will come later down the line when you have no idea what to do for any errors you get or will not be able to know what is happening within your own project. 

# Milestone 2: Connecting Firebase

This milestone focuses on creating a firebase account, and accessing your web API file. Firebase provides this file for you when you create a new project. Your goal will be to bring this file into your project, and set up your sign in and create user functions. The sign in page and create user page are configured for you. Your goal is to make both of these pages operational and to navigate to the final page of the project where you will encounter milestone 3. You will not find any information wihtin this read me that pertains to milestone 3, as the information for milestone 3 is kept within the final page. Once you access this page you will get all the information you will need to continue and finish this project. This portion will teach you the beginnings of what it means to add authentication to any projects you will build in the future. Presentation of what they will build.
